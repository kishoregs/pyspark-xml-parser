This implementation includes:
A sample QRDA Category I XML file with basic patient information and a blood pressure observation
A PySpark script that:
Creates a Spark session with the necessary XML parsing package
Reads and parses the XML file
Extracts patient information and clinical observations into separate dataframes
Handles errors appropriately
Displays the parsed data
To run this code:
Save the XML content to sample_qrda.xml
2. Save the Python code to qrda_parser.py
Install required dependencies:
pyspark
4. Run the script:
py
The code will output two dataframes: one with patient information and another with clinical observations from the QRDA document.
